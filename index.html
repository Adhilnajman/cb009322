                        <h2>Welcome to Dehiwala Zoo </h2><br>The Dehiwala National Zoo, which has a remarkable collection of exotic and indigenous fauna, is one of the oldest Zoos in Asia. The Zoo in Sri Lanka is widely known as Colombo Zoo all over the world.
                        Currently, Dehiwala Zoo houses 72 species of Mammals, 65 species of Birds, 31 species of Reptiles, 89 species of Fish, 03 families of Amphibians and 30 species of Butterflies etc. The total number of animals varies from 2500-3000
                        due to breeding and free living colonies of birds.

                        <br><br> Dehiwala Zoo has become famous among the visitors not only for collection of local and exotic animals but also for landscaping with lush greeneries. The Zoo supports and promotes conservation by breeding certain rare and
                        endangered species through proper animal welfare. Annually, over one and half million local and foreign tourists visit the Zoo. And over 2000 students and groups of students from schools and universities visit the Zoo for educational
                        purposes. The Zoo is trying to keep the pace with the changing world. It has been involved in some major redevelopment programmes with the aim of enhancing the overall image of the Zoo while providing maximum facilities for animals
                        and the visitors.</p>
